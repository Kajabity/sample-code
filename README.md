SampleCode for Kajabity.com Articles
====================================

This Git repository holds various kinds of sample code for articles on the [Kajabity.com]{http://www.kajabity.com} website.

Each folder is named after the article and contains the code for a single article or a related series.

Note: Google Calendar API has been changed - in particular the .../full/ doesn't work (it's V2) - so I've switched it to use the 
/basic view - I'll update again soon to make better use of this basic view, before I work out how to use the V3 API.
